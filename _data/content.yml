  <p><b>I love my job.</b> I get to create something that connects people. Every night,
  I go to sleep (yes, even the weekends) wondering&hellip;how can I make something
  better than I did the day before. And what gets me excited is knowing that I have
  the chance to improve everything I&rsquo;ve already built, design things that I haven&rsquo;t
  done or thought of, and having the opportunity to learn. I love absorbing information,
  and everyday that I learn something, is a great day.</p>

  <p>Optimism. I apply daily into my code. Nothing is impossible and everything is
  human-centric; this is my philosophy about building something great. As a client-side
  engineer for over a decade, I was told that &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be done&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t support that.&rdquo; But we can, and it&rsquo;s all about making
  the right decisions when opportunities arise. That is what motivated me to learn more
  about server and database architecture. Design isn&rsquo;t just about making something
  look good. Design is about architecting something usable, extendable, and easy for
  the next person stepping into my shoes to learn and continue building.</p>

  <p>My name is Josh, let&rsquo;s connect and build something meaningful.</p>
